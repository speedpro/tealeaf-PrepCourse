1.  I expected an uninitialised variable, but it evaluated to nil since it was inside an if block.

2.  informal_greeting references the object inside the greetings hash, and the shovel operator mutates the object, so greetings will output { a: "hi there" }

    A)  one is one
        two is two
        three is three

    B)  one is one
        two is two
        three is three

    C)  one is two
        two is three
        three is one
